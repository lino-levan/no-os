# No-OS

A small project for emulating a terminal-based shell purely in the web. Super
early days and I'm not sure how long I want to continue this project but here
are the "binaries" that are roughly supported:

- cat
- cd
- curl
- echo
- env
- exec (kind of)
- ls
- mkdir
- pwd
- rm
- touch
- whoami

## TODO

- [ ] Move shell into OS and have it interact with the page through /dev/console
- [ ] Implement processes
- [ ] Implement permissions
- [ ] Implement symlinks
- [ ] Add git through isomorphic-git and a custom fs implementation
- [ ] Create a package manager
